# Concert Booking system

  

> This is our final project as part of the requirement of the course Windows Programming (CS223). It is a winform app that allows users to book a concert event of their choice, a user can only book 5 tickets for a concert event at a time, this policy is in effect to discourage unfair ticket-buying practices. It has a 2-level user category: one as an administrator with special privileges such as adding/editing/removing concert events, artists, and genres and another for a regular customer. All the data in this application is stored and handeled using SQL server.
